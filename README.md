# Geospatial-Intelligence-Dashboard-Singapore-Condominium-Launches

Developed an interactive Power BI dashboard designed to visualize recent and upcoming private residential launches in Singapore during my internship for company usage. The tool transforms static property data into dynamic geospatial intelligence to support the company's research division and agents in client advisory. 

Key Features:
Geospatial Integration: Integrated OneMap Singapore as a custom basemap to provide high-resolution, street-level context for housing developments.
Regional Segmentation: Implemented custom GeoJSON polygon overlays to visualize and color-code URA planning regions (CCR, RCR, and OCR), allowing users to identify supply density across specific districts.
Data Visualization: Mapped critical project details—including unit counts, land tenure types (GLS/En Bloc), and proximity to amenities (MRT, schools)—onto an interactive interface.
UI/UX Design: Utilized Bookmarks and Selection Panes to create collapsible slicer panels, ensuring a clean user interface without sacrificing advanced filtering capabilities.
Data Engineering: Leveraged Excel and Power Query for data consolidation and coordinate precision formatting, alongside DAX for calculated measures.
